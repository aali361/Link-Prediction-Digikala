"""
This is my final project in Complex Networks course in Amirkabir university
In this project we use various techniques for link prediction in Digikala dataset
Digikala has published some of it's datasets for researchers
We use Orders table of this dataset that have 200k order in it
Our result shows that Machnie Learning techniques have best accuracy in this task
Our source code and result are published for additional research and good purposes
You can use our code in Colab easily
