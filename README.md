In this project we examine three approaches to link prediction in Digikala data
set. Our result shows that machine learning has booming landscape in this area. 
Our final purpose is to use this link prediction approach to improve recommender 
systems.

We first create a bipartite graph from user-product data. Then we do one-mode
method and get products graph and we do link prediction on this graph.

We use three approaches for our purpose:

Network properties like (Common Neighborhood, Jaccard, Adamic/Adar)
Matrix completion
Machine learning methods (SVM, Linear Regression) 

Our results shows that Machine Learning approaches has best performances in this
area. We evaluate these approaches by P@K measurement. You can see our results
in below picture:
